# Pyre

Pyre is a command-line interface for Tinder built at the [2015 Stupid Shit No
One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon](https://stupidhackathon.github.io/) in San
Francisco.

## Installation

    $ go get github.com/zachlatta/pyre

If you don't have Go on your system, or would rather download a static binary,
head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/zachlatta/pyre/releases) and
grab the latest binary for your system.

## Usage

    $ pyre -token="insert access token" -id="insert facebook user id"

Get your Facebook ID
[here](https://findmyfbid.in/). Get your Tinder access token
[here](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=464891386855067&redirect_uri=https://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html&scope=basic_info,email,public_profile,user_about_me,user_activities,user_birthday,user_education_history,user_friends,user_interests,user_likes,user_location,user_photos,user_relationship_details&response_type=token).

Once there, go to your browser's developer console, click to the Network tab, and
go to the above URL again. After the second traversal, you should see two network
calls on the developer console. Click the first one and look at its response
headers. There should be a "location" field in the header. The value of that
field should contain an auth_token.

#### Keybindings

Pyre has vi keybindings, of course.

| Action        | Key |
|---------------|-----|
| Like          | `l` |
| Pass          | `h` |
| Dismiss popup | `j` |

## Credits

Thank you to [norwack](https://github.com/norwack) for building the
[original Tinder library](https://github.com/norwack/tinder) that I
[forked](https://github.com/zachlatta/tinder) and made a few minor changes to
for Pyre.
